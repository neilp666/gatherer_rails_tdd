# TDD


Use TDD process to create and adjust your code's design in small
incremental tests.

Create test -> Make sure test fails -> Write simplest Code -> Refactor


Where to start?  - Initialising objects

Write tests to describe your codes behavior not its implementation

Typical test structure

1. Given: What data does the test need (test needs a project or one task)
2. When: What action is taking place?
3. Then: What behavior do we need to specify
